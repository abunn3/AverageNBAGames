# AverageNBAGames
R script to gather and plot an average NBA game for every team using facet_wrap

Just note that I'm just a hobbiest programmer and only picked up R about a month ago. Other than that go crazy. 
If you use my code please at least acknowledge me either through my reddit (u/abunn3) or Twitter (a_bunn) handles. 
Oh and change the color pallete so I can try to own the look of my charts. Thanks!
